If you miss the train i am on,
you will know that i am gone.
You can see the whole blow,
a hundred miles.
lord i am one,lord i am two ,
lord i am three,lord i am fout,
lord i am five hundred miles away from home.
away from home,away from home,away from home,away from home.
lord i am five hundred miles away from home.
not a shirt on my back,
not a penny to my name,
lord i can't go back home this away.
